# WordSearch

The WordSearch project allows a user to generate a word search of varying difficulty based on user given words.

User is able to generate, view, and view solutions for a word search based on their own word inputs.

Known issues:
  -If word is placed onto grid and runs into other word, the start of the first word will show up in the solution until it runs into the other word.
  -If word length is longer than default setting for difficulty level, returns an error.
